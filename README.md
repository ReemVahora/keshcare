# KeshCare: Ayurvedic Haircare AI Assistant

KeshCare is an interactive AI chatbot that guides users through personalized Ayurvedic haircare recommendations based on their unique hair profile and dosha analysis. Combining ancient wisdom with modern AI, KeshCare helps you understand your hairâ€™s needs and care for it naturally.

My aim is to provide users with personalised recommended ingredients for users curious about Indian haircare especially those who are yet to hear about Ayurveda. Indian hair has attracted attention worldwide and now many people share online on how hair oiling has changed their life! My hope for this project is to introduce, or educate users further on Ayurvedic recommendations and principles, so that they are recommended hair oils and routines personalised for them, achieving balance in their haircare.
